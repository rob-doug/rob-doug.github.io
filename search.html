    <p>Having lost his hand at the tender age of sixteen while abroad Captain Blackbread's ship, Tyrion Scurvvy-Dawg realized that the pirate's life would likely lead to an early grave. Determined to prevent other young seadogs from following in his footsteps, Mr. Scurvvy-Dawg to start a mentoring program to guide youth away from the pirate life. In his spare time, Tyrion works on a six-finger keyboard for retired pirates so that they too can become programmers. Additionally, he is writing the sixth volume of the Game of Thrones since the original author has apparently decided to do everything but that. </p>
